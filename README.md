# testnet-canonical

## This repository is the starting point for anyone wanting to work on or test the bitcoin-hivemind project.
+ Instructions for developers and testers
+ Modified testnet seeder (syncs only to the last canonical block height)
+ Script to generate canonical blockchain data using the hivemind-cli
+ Backups of the canonical blockchain(s)

### To start devloping / testing (environment setup and building)
1. You may use the following guide to setup a remote node, or follow the instructions on a virtual machine / your local system [Fullnode setup guide](https://github.com/bitcoin-hivemind/hivemind/blob/master/doc/fullnode-setup.txt)

2. Edit your configuration file (~/.hivemind/hivemind.conf) and append the following line
  ```
  testnet=1
  ```

3. Start the client of your choice (hivemindd & hivemind-cli or hivemind-qt) You should connect automatically to the testnet seeder node(s), if not run the following command through the debug window or hivemind-cli
  ```
  addnode 162.243.37.30 onetry
  ```
  
### To reset your environment and start over with the canonical blockchain data for testing
1. Make sure that all instances of hivemind (hivemindd, hivemind-cli and hivemind-qt) are completely shutdown
  ```
  ps -aux | grep hivemind
  ```
  The above command will list any process on the system with the name hivemind, look for any running daemons or hivemind-qt instances.

2. Remove hivemind's data directory <b>Warning: be careful with the rm command, it will permantely delete files</b> also note that this will remove all transactions, blocks, your configuration files and all of your private keys (coins) which you have created with hivemind.
  ```
  rm -rf ~/.hivemind/
  ```
  
3. Remove the directory to which you have built hivemind, re download the source code and build it fresh again using the [Fullnode setup guide](https://github.com/bitcoin-hivemind/hivemind/blob/master/doc/fullnode-setup.txt)
